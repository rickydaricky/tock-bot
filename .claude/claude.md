# Claude Code Project Notes

## Development Workflow

### After Code Changes
**IMPORTANT**: Always run `npm run build` after making code changes to ensure the extension is properly built and ready to load in the browser.

```bash
npm run build
```

This builds the TypeScript source files and bundles the extension for Chrome.
