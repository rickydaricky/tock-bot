# Product Context: Tock Reservation Form Filler

## Problem Statement
Restaurant reservations on Tock often require multiple manual inputs and clicks for each search attempt. Users frequently need to:
1. Select the number of diners
2. Choose a date
3. Select a preferred time
4. Click the search button

This process becomes tedious when checking multiple dates/times or when trying to find available reservations at popular restaurants.

## User Pain Points
- Repetitive manual form filling when checking multiple date/time combinations
- Slow workflow when trying to find available reservations
- Need to repeat the entire process when modifying just one parameter (like changing the date)
- Frustration when trying to secure reservations at high-demand restaurants

## User Experience Goals
- Reduce time spent on form filling by 80%
- Allow users to quickly modify search parameters through a dedicated UI
